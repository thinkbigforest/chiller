# chiller
use dymola
This is an example of a chiller system experiment using R-134a as the working fluid. A vapor compression cycle with water as the auxiliary fluid in the condenser and evaporator transfers heat from a low temperature heat source to a high temperature radiator. The superheat of the evaporator is controlled by the expansion valve. During the simulation, transients were applied to the liquid-fluid boundary conditions of the two heat exchangers.
